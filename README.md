This research aims to develop automatic digital literature curation for
digital platforms and media in Bahasa Indonesia to filter any
inappropriate words and sentences in the content. We developed
an inappropriate word corpus by gathering the restricted words
on KBM.id and adding several negative words based on common
knowledge. In this research, we employed the RNN-based method,
1D-CNN, and SVM as a model classifier to predict the input
sentence into a binary classification output. We utilized the digital
literature from the KBM App database as our benchmark dataset.
As a result, GRU obtained the best classification result compared
to other methods with an accuracy of 0.99. This study realized
the automatic digital literature curation in Bahasa Indonesia with
a very high accuracy.
